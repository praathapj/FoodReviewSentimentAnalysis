I visit Here regularly for lunch or dinner good taste . Price is Okey.  Pepper chicken ND grill is good . Gee rice biriyani rice . Overall  food is Okey.  Place has to maintain bit clean other then that it's good place to eat..
Good food and take away. Done in not great service he forgot one order itself when visited last time. Food is recommended
This is one of the restaurant which I likes more. Worth for money. Also foods are good taste except Mutton briyani which average. Chicken briyani taste is good. Must try Alfaham Chicken.
